# Build a wifi-based key generation system  
The WIFI-based key generation system is designed and built on Raspberry Pis(Alice and Bob), applying the unpredictable features of the wireless channel to realize protection on the
physical layer. 
## Principle Description
The key generation procedure contains four steps:  
* channel probing  
* quantization  
* information reconciliation  
* privacy amplification
